</p>
<p>
    In the "Manage" section, configure Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to define response and resolution times for tickets based on priority levels. For example, set a 1-hour response time for urgent tickets and a 24-hour resolution time for standard requests. Apply these SLAs to departments or specific ticket types as needed.
